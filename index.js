// This file helps Vercel understand the project structure
// For a static site, we don't need to implement a full server

console.log('Personal Potions Site is running');

// If this were a server-side app, we'd have code like:
// 
// const express = require('express');
// const app = express();
// const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
// 
// app.use(express.static('.'));
// 
// app.listen(port, () => {
//   console.log(`Personal Potions site listening on port ${port}`);
// });

// But for a static site with Vercel, we don't need this.
